Self-balanced IPv4-IPv6 lossless translator with dynamic addresses mapping.

Current version of DirecTo provides dynamic addresses mapping, is ready for lossless translation and does not need Application Layer Gateways (ALGs). DirecToBot directory contains source codes for the translator nodes and DirecTo6 directory contains source codes for IPv4 nodes. DirecTo4 directory is empty but should get a specular development compared to DirecTo6 by those interested.

This is a project developed at the University of Rome Tor Vergata.

Forks and public contributions are encouraged.
