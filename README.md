Self-balanced IPv4-IPv6 lossless translator with dynamic addresses mapping

Current version of DirecTo allow dynamic address mapping and is ready for lossless translation. Moreover, it does not need Application Layer Gateways (ALGs). DirecToBot directory contains source codes for the translator nodes and DirecTo6 directory contains source codes for IPv4 nodes. DirecTo4 directory is empty and it should get a specular development compared to DirecTo6.

This is a project developed at the University of Rome Tor Vergata.
